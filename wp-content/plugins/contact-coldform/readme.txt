== Description ==

Contact Coldform is designed with a sharp focus on clean code, solid performance, and ease of use. No frills, no gimmicks, only pure contact-form satisfaction. If you are looking for a solid, well-designed, user-friendly, fully customizable contact form, look no further: Coldform is perfect for any WordPress blogger. The comprehensive Options panel makes Coldform easy for beginners to take full control, while the consistent, logical PHP/(X)HTML code makes Coldform ideal for advanced users desiring customized functionality. The best of both worlds: a "clean-slate" contact form that provides everything you want and nothing you don't!

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the "contact-coldform" directory.
2. Upload directory to your "plugins" folder and activate.
3. Insert <code><!--coldform--></code> to any page or post.
4. Customize your preferences in the Coldform Admin Options panel.

Note: when including the <code><!--coldform--></code> tag into your posts and pages, it is important to **disable the rich-text editor** before doing so. The setting for the RTE is located in your User Profile Page.

**Styling Contact Coldform**

Contact Coldform features the following default CSS hooks:

* The entire form is enclosed within <code><div id="coldform"></code> for easy, targeted styling.
* Each form section is enclosed within a <code><fieldset></code> for usability and accessibility.
* Each <code><fieldset></code> contains a <code><legend class="hide"></code> that may be hidden.
* Each input field has a corresponding label: <code><label class="label"></code>.
* Each input label has a corresponding input: <code><input class="input" type="text"></code>.
* The form submit button includes its own submit class: <code><input class="submit"></code>.
* Coldform contains a <code><div class="clear"></div></code> to ensure proper layout.
* Everything else is customizable via the Coldform Options panel.

To help get you going with styling the Colform, I have prepared a number of "Coldskins" that you can just drop into your theme's style.css file. To download some of these plug-n-play CSS templates, check out: http://perishablepress.com/press/2008/01/15/contact-coldskins/
